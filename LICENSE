CONTROL HACK 2026 🔥🎯

Undetected Control cheat — keyless external/internal hybrid for dominating the Oldest House, Hiss battles, side missions, exploration, collectibles, power mastery, service weapon upgrades, and Jesse Faden’s journey (February 2026)!  
Silent Aimbot, ESP/Wallwatch (Hiss/enemies/loot/collectibles/hidden paths/objects of power), No Recoil, Radar, Infinite Health/Energy/Ammo, Speedhack, Fly, Noclip, One-Hit Kill, Auto-Parry, Auto-Dodge, Auto-Counter, Auto-Collect Loot, Auto-Quest Complete, Instant Ability Unlock, Service Weapon Switcher, Astral Plane Assist, Streamproof & more 💀

Standalone .exe — no injector needed, run as admin and seize control.  
Works on latest Control Ultimate Edition (PC version v1.10–v1.12 patches, Remedy / Epic AC active).  
Status: Undetected low-key/closet (community tested on PC, HWID spoof — rage/AC waves ban fast if overused) 🟢🟠

Why this hack survives custom AC in 2026  
- Simple: .exe → Control → auto-load  
- Humanized closet: smoothing, realistic FOV, no obvious animations or stats spikes  
- Kernel AC bypass — streamproof overlays, no server-side checks triggered, compatible with all DLCs (The Foundation & AWE expansions)  
- ESP: enemies (Hiss-corrupted agents, drones, floating objects, mold-1, anchor entities, bosses), NPCs (allies, Ahti, Polaris), loot crates, collectibles (documents, research materials, hotbar items, nursery rhymes, altered items), hidden paths, ambushes, guard patrols, weak points on armored enemies highlighted  
- Updates post-DLC/patch (new abilities like Levitate upgrades, new locations like The Foundation & Bright Falls, new weapons mods)  
- No key/sub — loader style  
- Windows 10/11 64-bit (Epic Games Store / Steam)
